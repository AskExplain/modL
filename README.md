# modL
A modular approach to data analysis 

The model enables the transfer of information from spatial transcriptomics technologies (ST-tech) to single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) - essentially building a bridge based on transfer learning.

This allows for a two way approach that enables:

1 - Spatial to Gene expression: Alignment of a reference cell atlas to non-ST-tech histology slides, predicting gene expression

2 - Gene expression to Spatial: Transformation of gene expression only vectors to spatial image tiles
